Qualitatively you observed a reduction in noise, but the quantitative estimate
of SNR improvement did not achieve the theoretical $\sqrt{3}$ because you
didn't take into account what the ``true'' signal should be (I didn't tell you
what is was); performing mean and standard deviation operations over the entire
signal includes the variability of the actual signal (which in this case was a
\verb+rect+).

Remember that SNR =
$\frac{\textrm{P}_{\textrm{signal}}}{\textrm{P}_{\textrm{noise}}}$.  If we look
at the SNR improvement in the data from Problem Set \#6 in the region of the
\verb+rect+ that has actual signal (non-zero values), then we get the
following:

Looking at the SNRs calculated above, how does the SNR improvement compare with
the ``expected'' $\sqrt{3}$?  Why might this be?

The SNR improvement is $\frac{10^{28.1/20}}{10^{15.2/20}} \simeq 4.4 >
\sqrt{3}$.  This is partially due to the fact that the $\sqrt{N}$ rule-of-thumb
was derived under the assumption of a normal distribution of data points;
having such a small number of points violates that assumption.\\
