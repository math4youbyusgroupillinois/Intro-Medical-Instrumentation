\item {\bf Boxcar Averager} A sliding window averager has a window length of
three samples.  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Using Matlab, plot, on the same axes, the input and output of
this averager given the input samples listed below. Assume that the input at
times \textit{before} and \textit{after} these samples is equal to zero. \\

\centerline{0~~ 0.2~~ 0~~ -0.1~~ 0.3~~ 0.8~~ 1.2~~ 0.9~~ 1.1~~ 1.2~~ 0.8~~ 1.1~~ 1.2~~ 0.8~~ 1.1~~ 0~~ -0.2~~ -0.1~~ 0~~ -0.2~~}

\item If the actual signal trying to be represented by these samples is: \\

\centerline{0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 1.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~ 0.0~~}

then comment on the pros / cons of the sliding averager relative to recovering
the actual signal.
