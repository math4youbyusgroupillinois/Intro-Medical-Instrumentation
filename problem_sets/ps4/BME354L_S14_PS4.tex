\item \textbf{Arduino Implementation of Averagers}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Build an Arduino-controlled circuit that modulates the brightness
            of an LED with a sine wave that has a 5 s period.
        \item Add noise to your sinusoid using \verb+random()+ to achieve an
            SNR of 6 dB.
        \item Run your code with the noisy sinusiod and note the difference in
            your LED illumination.
        \item Implement a boxcar averager in your Arduino code to filter the
            noise sinusoid to illuminate the LED more like the pure sinusoid.
        \item Include in your code comments your analysis / reasoning for
            choosing the size of your boxcar.
        \item Submit your functioning code as part of your attachment to the
            Sakai assignment.
