$$S_{o} = \frac{1}{m}\left[S_n + \left(\frac{m-1}{m}\right)S_{n-1}+\left(\frac{m-1}{m}\right)^2S_{n-2} + ...\right]$$

Lets see how the weights change as a function of $m$ for 30 samples (Figure~\ref{fig:exp_weight_ave}).

\end{figure}

Notice that as $m$ increases, the impact of older samples increases.  In the
limiting case ($m$ = 1), we simply have a delta function for the most recent
sample.  Question to consider: How does the overall energy of the output signal
change as a function of $m$?  Is it constant?

The SNR improvement of the exponential averager is a function of $m$.  There is no SNR improvement for $m = 1$.

For the exponential averager, the new average estimate ($A_m$) can be related to the previous estimate ($A_{m-1}$) with a new input ($I_m$), as:

\begin{equation}
A_m = A_{m-1} + \frac{I_m - A_{m-1}}{m} = \frac{1}{M}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^m \left( \frac{M-1}{M}\right)^{m-i} I_i,
\label{eqn:expSNR}
\end{equation}

where $M$ is the number of samples with history in the averager.

The derivation of the SNR associated with the exponential averager can be expressed after expansion of Equation~\ref{eqn:expSNR} as:

\begin{equation}
\displaystyle\lim_{m \rightarrow \infty} \textrm{SNR}_\textrm{o} \frac{\left[ 1-(1-\frac{1}{M})^m \right]}{\left[ \frac{1-(1-\frac{1}{M})^{2m}}{2M-1}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}} = \textrm{SNR}_\textrm{o} (2M-1)^{\frac{1}{2}},
\end{equation}

where $\textrm{SNR}_\textrm{o}$ is the original signal SNR.

The filtering characteristics of the boxcar averager, as a function of the length of the boxcar, are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:boxcar_fft}.  Notice how for a single sample boxcar length (i.e., a delta function), all frequencies are passed (i.e., a uniform transfer function), but as the length of the boxcar increases, the passband of the transfer function reduces down to something that, in the extreme, would be a delta function at $f$ = 0, only allowing DC characteristics to be preserved.

\end{figure}

To compare/contrast, the power spectra of the exponential averager for 3 different $m$ weights are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:exp_fft}.  Notice how for increasing $m$, the passband of the exponential averager transfer function becomes significantly limited, effectively acting as a low-pass filter, similar to what happens with the boxcar averager, but to less of an extreme.
