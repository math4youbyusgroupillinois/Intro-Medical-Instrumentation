\section{Practical Engineering: Outlets and Plugs}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe the difference between a ``hot'' and ``neutral'' wires with
respect to an electrical outlet.

\item What purpose does the round, centered prong serve on a typical
three-pronged plug / outlet?  As part of your answer, sketch a simple circuit
diagram showing how this would be connected (1) to the device, and (2) to the
``hot'' and/or ``neutral'' connections.  What role does this center prong play
in patient / operator safety in the context of a medical device?

\item One of the two ``flat'' prongs on an electrical plug tends to wider than
the other prong, forcing you to plug it into an outlet in a certain
orientation.  Describe why this is done and how that relates to the safety of
the user of that device.

\item Describe how a Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlet works.
Where do you typically find this type of outlet in your home / apartment,
and why are they more commonly found there compared to other rooms in your
home?

\item Describe how a circuit breaker works.  Compare/contrast circuit breakers
with fuses.  Describe how an Arc Fault Circuit Interrupter (AFCI) circuit
breaker works compared to non-AFCI breakers.
