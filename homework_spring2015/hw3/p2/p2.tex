\section{Filter Design and Bode Plots:}
Design a passive RC highpass filter that will attenuate signals with frequencies of 600 rad/sec by 20 dB.
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw your circuit.
\item Derive its transfer function.
\item What is your desired cutoff frequency?
\item What component values  (R, C?) will you use?
\item Draw the Bode plot (both magnitude and phase) for your circuit.
\item Now design a passive RL highpass filter with the same cutoff frequency
and draw your circuit.
\item What component values will you use?
\item Describe the differences (if any) you would expect in the Bode plots between your RL and RC filters.
\end{itemize}
