\section{Practical Issues- Batteries:}
    Rechargeable, battery-powered devices are becoming more ubiquitous
    in the medical setting.  Compare/contrast these four types of rechargeable
    batteries in terms of energy density, output voltage, battery life,
    recharge time, and weight: (1) lead acid, (2) NiCad, (3) NIMH, and (4)
    Li-ion.

    Li-ion batteries have become very common in cell phones, digital cameras,
    laptop computers, and many other portable electronic devices.
    Unfortunately, there is also a non-negligible fire risk associated with
    these devices.  What is responsible for this fire risk, and what safeguards
    do modern versions of these batteries utilize?
