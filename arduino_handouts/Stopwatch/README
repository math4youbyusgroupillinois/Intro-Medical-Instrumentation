Stopwatch code for the Arduino Lab 1 exercise, originally written by Oliver
Fang and modified by me to demonstrate some different functionality.  This code
utilizes the millis() function to clock elapsed time.  Multiple *.ino files in
this directory are used to demonstrate some modular code writing functionality.
