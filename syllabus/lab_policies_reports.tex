\section{Lab Policies \& Reports}
\subsection{Policies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Laboratory work is worth 30\% of your final grade for this course.
        This includes your pre-lab assignments, active participation during
        lab, appropriate data recording / documentation in your Sakai group lab
        folder, and your submitted work for each lab.  
    \item Labs are due 1 week after you perform the lab.
 Reports will be \textbf{electronically
            submitted via Sakai}.  When in doubt about a due date, please check Sakai to determine when a lab
        report is due.
    \item Late lab reports will be penalized 50\% of otherwise earned credit
        for being up to one day late.  Lab reports greater that one day late
        will receive no credit, but must be completed and turned in to pass the
        class.  {\bf Late lab reports must be submitted through Sakai, which
            Dr. Nightingale will have to give you access to do after the original
            due date.}
    \item You must inform Dr. Nightingale if you have a known conflict with
        attending a lab \emph{at least one week before that lab}.  \textbf{Two
            unexcused absences from lab will result in an automatic failure of
            the course.}

    \item \textbf{You cannot attend the lab section that you are not enrolled in!}
    \item All laboratory exercises and reports must be completed to pass this
        course.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pre-lab Assignments, Sakai Data Storage / Documentation, Lab Procedures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All pre-laboratory questions and calculations must also be completed
        \underline{before} lab and electronically submitted before the start of
        lab (one per group). Additionally, for some labs, you will be asked to
        complete Arduino code before lab.  Lab-specific details will be
        provided when appropriate.  These pre-laboratory assignments are 
        10\% of each lab's grade, and late pre-laboratory submissions will not
        receive any credit.
    \item Electronically record notes of your procedures and results throughout
        the lab using the PCs in the laboratory, and upload all electronic
        documents (text files, spreadsheets and screen captures) to your Sakai
        account so your TAs can review this materials if necessary.  \emph{Make
            sure that your notes have adequate details to complete your lab
            report, including all necessary data and screen captures.}
    \item You and your lab partner must clear your lab bench space and
        return all parts after you have completed your experiment.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lab Reports}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each lab \underline{group} (i.e., you and your lab partner) must
        complete a lab writeup for each lab.  Like performing the lab exercise,
        the writing of the report and the data analysis should be even between
        the lab partners.
    
\item For most of your labs, you will NOT write a formal report. Rather, you will submit the pre-lab, as well as submitting answers to all the questions 
interspersed throughout the labs and the post-lab questions.
    \item  For two of your labs (Lab 6 (Incubator), and Lab 9 
(Pheumotachometer)), you will submit formal lab reports, using a standard
4-page conference proceedings paper format (a boiler plate will be posted on
Sakai for formatting).  The lab report cannot exceed 4 pages.
        You must adequately present results, discuss those results
        (including things that do not make sense, and why that may be the
        case), and appropriately answer any questions raised during the
        procedure and in the post-lab questions.  Distilling your information
        down to the pertinent points is more important than including the
        ``kitchen sink'' in these lab reports.
	For the Materials and Methods, you  should
        list the material and equipment
            used during the lab (e.g., Oscilloscope Tektronix TDS-1012).  You
           should NOT repeat the procedure already mentioned in the lab
            handout; simply reference it.  However, be sure to
include any deviations from the protocol,
            reasons for those deviations, etc.  After reading this section of
            the lab report, someone should be able to replicate what you did
            along with lab handout.
        \item \underline{Results \& Discussion}: Provide all of the data
            acquired in the lab in a meaningful and efficient format (e.g.,
            tables, plots, etc.).  All figures, tables, plots \emph{must} be
            numbered and labeled, with captions, and properly referenced in the
            text.  All figure and plot axes must be labeled and include units!!
            All results must include units!! Include all analyses discussed in
            the lab handout, and provide equations that were used in these
            analyses (and any intermediate steps if they are not obvious and
            are significant).  Answer all questions posed in the lab handout
            and post-lab questions (be sure to indicate the question number you
            are answering).  
        \item \underline{Conclusions}: A few sentences providing an overview of
            your findings, interesting observations, and overall success of
            your experiment.
    \item All lab submissions (formal reports and weekly lab summaries) must be generated using a word processor (e.g., Word) or
        typesetting program (e.g., \LaTeX) using a reasonable font size and
        single-spaced with clear section headings.
    \item {\bf PDF electronic versions of your lab submissions 
will be submitted to
            Sakai via the specific Lab Assignment that you and your lab partner
            will have access to.  Only one lab report needs to be submitted for
            each group.}
