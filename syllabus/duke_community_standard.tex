\section{Duke Community Standard}
Engineering is inherently a collaborative field, and in this class, you are
encouraged to work collaboratively on problem sets and lab reports.
 
The work that you submit must be the result of your own effort and reflect
your understanding of the material.  
  
There are inherently gray areas when working in groups, but submitting
individual assignments.   Given that, you are strongly advised to consult with
your instructor and your teaching assistants whenever you are unsure if you are
crossing the line between collaboration and copying another student's work.  As an
internal benchmark, you should be able to explain all work being submitted with
your name on it and be able to justify your choice for a solution methodology,
analysis technique or the way that you arrived at a final answer.

All students are expected to adhere to all principles of the
\href{http://www.integrity.duke.edu/standard.html}{Duke Community Standard}.
Violations of the Duke Community Standard will be referred immediately to the
Office of Student Conduct.
