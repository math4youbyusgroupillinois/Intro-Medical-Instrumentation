\section{Class \& Lab Attendance}

Lecture attendance is \emph{strongly} recommended since a considerable amount
of the material will be exclusively covered during lecture and not in a textbook.
Additionally, there will be some readiness assessments given throughout the
semester during the beginning lecture that cannot be made up outside of lecture.

Lab attendance is \emph{mandatory} for all labs.  Labs can only be made up with
an official excuse (Short Term Illness form) filed in advance of the scheduled
lab or a legitimate conflict that have you discussed with Dr. Palmeri
\textbf{at least a week in advance} of your scheduled lab.  Days/times to make
up labs will be decided by your TA, Matt Brown and Dr. Palmeri \textbf{in
advance} of missing lab, and your lab partner may be asked to attend that make
up time depending on the lab exercise.  All labs must be performed and complete
lab reports submitted to pass this class.  \emph{Two unexcused labs will result
in automatic failure of this class.}
