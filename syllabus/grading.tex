\section{Grading}
There will be one midterm exam and one final exam. Make-up exams will only be
given for official excuses provided as early as possible in advance of the
scheduled exam. Make-up exams must be
scheduled in advance of missing the exam or within 24 hours of submitting a
short-term illness form.
