\section{Grading}
There will be two midterm exams and a final project. Make-up exams will only be
given for official excuses provided as early as possible in advance of the
scheduled exam. Make-up exams will be oral exams with Dr. Palmeri that must be
scheduled in advance of missing the exam or within 24 hours of submitting a
short-term illness form.

The distribution of your grading is outlined in the table below:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
        Problem Sets \& Readiness Assessments & 25\% \\ \hline
        Labs & 25\% \\ \hline
        Exam I & 15\% \\ \hline
        Exam II & 15\% \\ \hline
        Final Project & 10\% \\ \hline
        Participation & 10\% \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Notice that your exams are worth significantly less than your problem sets and
labs\ldots and there is a final project in place of a final exam.
