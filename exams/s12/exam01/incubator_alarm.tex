\section{[25 points]}

An orthopedic surgery lab is growing cells for an experiment in two incubators
that must be held within 1 $^\circ$C of one another for 24 hours.  Each
incubator has a thermistor in it to measure temperature.  The thermistors have a
resistance of 1 k$\Omega$ at 27 $^\circ$C (the starting temperature of each
incubator), and that resistance varies by 10 $\Omega$ / $^\circ$C (consider the
error on these thermistors to be negligible).

Design a circuit that creates a 5 V output signal when there is a $\geq$ 1
$^\circ$C temperature difference between the two incubators (NOTE - that is a
relative difference in temperature, not an absolute deviation from 27
$^\circ$C).  Be sure to include a block diagram!

Design constraints:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use a \underline{single} Wheatstone bridge as a detection circuit for both thermistors,
    \item You only have a single power supply that provides $\pm$ 12 V for your circuit,
    \item You can use all analog circuit components, relays and transistors, but no digital logic gates.
\end{itemize}
