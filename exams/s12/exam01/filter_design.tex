\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design a circuit that has a transfer function approximated by the Bode magnitude plot above.  Specify all component values, including the power being supplied to any op amps that you choose to use.
    \item What is the maximum peak-to-peak input voltage that your circuit can input and still remain operating in its linear range for an input signal frequency of 10$^2$ rad/s and 10$^{10}$ rad/s?
    \item Evaluate $Z_{in}$ and $Z_{out}$ for your circuit as a whole (i.e., from its input and output terminals, respectively).
    \item Sketch the phase of the transfer function of your circuit over the same frequency range as the Bode plot above.
\end{enumerate}
